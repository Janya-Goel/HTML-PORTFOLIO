<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a curious and driven individual with a strong inclination toward continuous learning and personal growth.
  Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a keen interest in understanding how things work, especially 
  when it comes to systems and structures that drive innovation. I enjoy working in collaborative environments
  that challenge me to think critically and creatively.
</p>

<p>
  My primary area of interest lies in the field of technology. I am particularly drawn to how tech can be used
  to create meaningful change and improve everyday life. Whether it's exploring emerging trends, understanding
  data structures, or gaining insight into digital systems, I am always eager to deepen my knowledge and contribute
  in ways that align with real-world applications.
</p>

<p>Outside of academics, I have a few hobbies that help me stay balanced and inspired. I enjoy reading, listening 
  to music, and participating in activities that allow for creative expression. These interests, though simple, 
  offer me a refreshing break and keep me energized for the work Iâ€™m passionate about.
